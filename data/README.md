# Data

The document collection is MS MARCO Passages and has to be stored in `collection.tsv`.
Furthermore, for the `doc2query` based approaches, descriptive queries for each document in the collection must be stored in `doc2query.tsv`.
This file can be automatically generated using [this script](../scripts/doc2query-t5.py). :warning: May take several days.

A MS MARCO document collection has been provided [here](https://gustav1.ux.uis.no/dat640/msmarco-passage.tar.gz).
A pre-generated `doc2query.tsv` file has been made available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vGGGu0eprxG_iUm9Z5xkbsKEwjJoAf_A/view?usp=drive_link).
